## Project Summary / Scenario
The project was carried out within the following training context: the SoigneMoi hospital from the French region of Lille sought the services of a consulting company to develop a digital system. The goal was to implement various software solutions covering the needs of different stakeholders in the hospital: patients, administrators, doctors, and secretaries. This aimed to facilitate processes such as appointment scheduling, management of doctors' schedules, creation of prescriptions, and consultation of patientâ€™s records.
The time spent on the realization of this project was just under 18 weeks, approximately 4 months. However, the majority of this time was dedicated to my working hours within the framework of my internship.

The project realization included all stages: planning, designing of the apps, development, deployment, as well as documentation of the applications and related work. The applications to develop were the following: a website for patients and administrators, a mobile application for doctors, an office application for secretaries, and a backend responsible for managing the system's database and permissions for different users (patients, administrators, doctors, and secretaries).

Thanks to a careful choice of appropriate technologies and the setup of a meticulously prepared schedule, I was able to develop and deploy the applications in their entirety in time.
